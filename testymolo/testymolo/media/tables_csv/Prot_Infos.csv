The hydrophobic region is followed by a predicted signal peptide cleavage site,A-QIHW (position 135 to 139) . The amino acids 1 to 135 is refered as the Pre-region, a potential long signal peptide. The F protein amino-terminal extension modulates fusion function. The classical signal peptide of a type I glycoprotein is usually cleaved off cotranslationally and immediately degraded. Thus, it is not expected to have a significant influence on the biological activity of the protein. However, more complex roles for certain cellular signal peptides have been characterized, and it has been shown for other viral glycoproteins that their signal peptides are cleaved not cotranslationally but rather posttranslationally . Similar to the situation CDV, those signal peptides are unusually long and positively charged, which may delay protein processing. Consequently, reduction of the charge of these signal peptides, or replacement with short signal peptides from efficiently transported glycoproteins, leads to an increase in cleavage efficiency and subsequently to an increase of mature and active protein.The CDV F protein long amino-terminal extension has similar characteristics. The remarkable new property of this sequence is that it modulates function: mature F proteins derived from a  PreF0 precursor are less fusogenic than those derived from shorter precursors.', 11932382
